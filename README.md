The goal of the project is to solve some problem using at least two machine learning methods, comparing their performance in the process. My preliminary plan is to use race split data from various triathlon events to make predictions of the final and split times of contestants. I am currently in the process of contacting a major purveyor of real-time race statistics on it. If this fails, I will consider some text-based classification task based on open-source data.

**Project Stage Requirements**
In Stage 1:
Choose and formulate a machine learning problem.
Choose one ML method that is suitable for the problem.

In Stage 2:
Apply at least 2 ML Methods to the problem you formulated in Stage 1.
Compare and analyze the results, and choose the best method.
