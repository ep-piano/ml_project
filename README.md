The goal of the project is to solve some problem using at least two machine learning methods, comparing their performance in the process. I have chosen to solve a simple classification problem involving demographic statistics.

In Stage 1:
Choose and formulate a machine learning problem.
Choose one ML method that is suitable for the problem.

In Stage 2:
Apply at least 2 ML Methods to the problem you formulated in Stage 1.
Compare and analyze the results, and choose the best method.
